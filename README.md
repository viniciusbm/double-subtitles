# double-subtitles
Merges two SRT subtitle files into one SSA/ASS file (displayed at the top and at the bottom).

NB: I wrote this code several years ago, and since then I've only fixed bugs. The style and structure aren't the best, and I'll probably rewrite the code someday.

#### Usage:
```
double-subtitles.py top.srt bottom.srt > merged.ssa
```
